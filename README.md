# AgriFuture ðŸŒ±

A blockchain-based platform for sustainable agriculture, built for the Hedera Hackathon.

## Overview

AgriFuture is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to revolutionize the agricultural supply chain by empowering farmers with blockchain technology. Built for the Hedera Hackathon, AgriFuture leverages Hederaâ€™s blockchain to provide transparency, immutability, and security for tracking and tokenizing agricultural produce. The platform also plans to integrate Chainlink for real-time market data, ensuring fair pricing for farmers. AgriFuture promotes sustainable farming practices, reduces waste, and fosters a global marketplace for eco-friendly produce.

Key highlights:
- **Transparency**: Uses Hederaâ€™s Consensus Service to record produce data immutably.
- **Tokenization**: Enables farmers to tokenize crops as digital assets on Hederaâ€™s Token Service.
- **Sustainability**: Encourages eco-friendly farming with features like sustainability scoring and carbon offset tracking.
- **Accessibility**: Supports multiple languages (English/Spanish) for global reach.

## Vision

AgriFuture envisions a transparent, sustainable agricultural ecosystem using Hedera and Chainlink. We empower farmers to track, tokenize, and trade produce on Hedera, while Chainlink provides real-time market data for fair pricing. Our goal is to create a global, eco-friendly marketplace that connects farmers, buyers, and communities, driving a greener future for agriculture worldwide.

## Demo

A live demo of AgriFuture is available at [https://NyamumboC.github.io/AgriFuture/](https://NyamumboC.github.io/AgriFuture/). You can also watch a short demo video showcasing the platformâ€™s features and Hedera integration:


## Build Process

AgriFuture was developed as a React-based web application with a focus on blockchain integration and user experience. Below is a detailed breakdown of the build process.


### Frontend Development
- **Landing Page**:
  - Designed a simple landing page with a "Get Started" button and language toggle.
  - Used Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive layout.
- **Auth Modal**:
  - Built a modal for user login with `react-hook-form` to handle form inputs (username, password).
  - Added animations with `framer-motion` for smooth transitions.
- **Dashboard**:
  - Created a dashboard to display produce data using `chart.js` for bar charts and line graphs.
  - Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern look.
- **Tokenize Crop**:
  - Developed a form to tokenize crops, capturing details like product name, quantity, and sustainability score.
  - Integrated with Hedera to create tokens on the blockchain.
- **Navigation Menu**:
  - Added a sidebar with links to various features (e.g., Marketplace, P2P Trading).
  - Used Tailwind CSS for styling and `framer-motion` for hover effects.

### Hedera Integration
- **Setup**:
  - Installed the Hedera SDK (`@hashgraph/sdk`) to interact with the Hedera testnet.
  - Configured a Hedera client in `App.js` using testnet credentials.
- **Consensus Service**:
  - Implemented a `handleCreateTopic` function to create topics for recording produce data.
  - Used `TopicCreateTransaction` to create a topic on the testnet, logging the topic ID to the console.
- **Token Service**:
  - Implemented a `handleTokenizeCrop` function to tokenize crops.
  - Used `TokenCreateTransaction` to create a token for each crop, logging the token ID to the console.
- **Security**:
  - Stored Hedera credentials in a `.env` file to prevent hardcoding sensitive information.

### Chainlink Integration
- **Planned Integration**:
  - Planned to use Chainlink Price Feeds to fetch real-time market data for crops (e.g., price of wheat).
  - Due to time constraints, mocked the functionality with a `fetchMarketPrice` function in `App.js`.
- **Future Implementation**:
  - Will integrate Chainlinkâ€™s decentralized oracles to provide accurate market data for fair pricing in the marketplace.


### Challenges Faced
- **Hedera Setup**:
  - Initially struggled to set up a Hedera testnet account and obtain sufficient testnet HBAR. Resolved by using the Hedera portalâ€™s faucet.
- **Deployment Issues**:
  - Encountered errors due to long filenames in `node_modules` when deploying to GitHub Pages. Fixed by updating `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules` and focusing on the built files.
- **Time Constraints**:
  - Due to the hackathon deadline, mocked some functionality (e.g., Chainlink integration) but ensured core Hedera features were fully implemented.


## Technical Details

### Hedera Integration
AgriFuture uses Hederaâ€™s blockchain to ensure transparency and security:
- **Consensus Service**:
  - Creates topics to record produce data immutably on the Hedera testnet.
  - Example: The `handleCreateTopic` function in `App.js` uses `TopicCreateTransaction` to create a topic, logging the topic ID (e.g., `0.0.123456`) to the console.

- **Token Service**:
  - Tokenizes crops as digital assets, enabling secure tracking and trading.
  - Example: The `handleTokenizeCrop` function uses `TokenCreateTransaction` to create a token for a crop (e.g., "Wheat"), logging the token ID to the console.
- **Benefits**:
  - Hederaâ€™s low fees and high throughput make it ideal for agricultural use cases.
  - Immutability ensures trust between farmers and buyers.

### Chainlink Integration
- **Planned Feature**:
  - AgriFuture plans to integrate Chainlink Price Feeds to fetch real-time market data (e.g., the price of wheat).
  - This will ensure fair pricing in the marketplace and P2P trading features.
- **Current State**:
  - Mocked the functionality with a `fetchMarketPrice` function due to time constraints.
  - Example: `fetchMarketPrice("wheat")` returns a mocked price of `$300 per ton`.
- **Future Implementation**:
  - Will use Chainlinkâ€™s decentralized oracles to fetch accurate, tamper-proof market data.
- 
### Other Integrations
- **Chart.js**:
  - Used in the dashboard to visualize produce data (e.g., bar charts for quantity over time).
- **React Hook Form**:
  - Handles form inputs in the auth modal and tokenize crop form, ensuring efficient validation.
- **Framer Motion**:
  - Adds smooth animations (e.g., modal transitions, button hover effects).
- **React Toastify**:
  - Displays notifications (e.g., "Token created successfully").
- **Tailwind CSS**:
  - Provides responsive, modern styling across the app.
